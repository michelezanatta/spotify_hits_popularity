This is the report of the Statistical Learning course final project. 

The project has been carried out in a group of three. In the PDF you will find the project steps descriptions, along with the code written in R.
The objectives of the project were to learn how to work in a group and to put into practice what we have learned during the course.

In the end, I am able to say that both objectives have been accomplished remarkably well.
